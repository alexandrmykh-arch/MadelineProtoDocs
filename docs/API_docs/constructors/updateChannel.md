# Constructor: updateChannel  
[Back to constructors index](/API_docs/constructors/index.html)



Channel/supergroup ([channel](../constructors/channel.html) and/or [channelFull](../constructors/channelFull.html)) information was updated.

This update can only be received through getDifference or in [updates](../constructors/updates.html)/[updatesCombined](../constructors/updatesCombined.html) constructors, so it will **always** come bundled with the updated [channel](../constructors/channel.html), that should be applied [as usual Â»](https://core.telegram.org/api/peers), **without** re-fetching the info manually.

However, full peer information will not come bundled in updates, so the full peer cache ([channelFull](../constructors/channelFull.html)) must be invalidated for `channel_id` when receiving this update.
